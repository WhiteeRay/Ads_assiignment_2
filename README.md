##Assignment 2 By Aknur Mazhitova
1. This project contains implementations of common data structures in Java, including:
MyArrayList, MyLinkedList, MyStack, MyQueue, MyMinHeap
2. There are also testers that test all the methods of each class.
3. User can run the testers through the main program by choosing 1-5. To exit, input 0.
##Test
The tests are designed to verify the correctness of each data structure's functionality.
If all methods pass, youâ€™ll see the message All tests passed!. If any test fails,
the program will point out the failed test.
